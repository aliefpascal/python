# error_propagation
Quadratic cost function of $L$ layers network for a single training example is

$$\tag{1}
C = \frac12 \sum_j (y_j - a^L_j)^2
$$

with the activation $a_j^L$ of the $j^{\rm th}$ neuron in the $L^{\rm th}$ layer, which is output of the network and $y_j$ is the corresponding desired output of the $j^{\rm th}$ neuron.
